//           <h2>1. Set SMART goals</h2>
//           <p>
//             Your team can prioritize <a target='_blank' href='https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-write-smart-goals'>SMART goals</a> by choosing objectives that are
//             Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time-based. For
//             example, you may want to exceed your quarterly quota by 10% by the
//             end of the second quarter.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             After implementing these objectives, track progress regularly. Since
//             every member shares the same team-specific metrics, your team can
//             monitor advancement and celebrate accomplishments. Measuring
//             progress with a single metric rather than applying their own
//             definitions of success helps individual team members more accurately
//             understand their progress.

//           <h2>2. Perform well-defined roles</h2>
//           <p>
//             Teams tend to work best when each member is responsible for
//             contributing something specific. When team members have well-defined
//             roles, they can focus on accomplishing individual tasks and
//             following specific workflows rather than devoting energy to
//             identifying their place. For example, you can assign some team
//             members to take charge of leading different project types, while
//             others may conduct research, perform analysis or recommend
//             solutions.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             In some cases, teams may achieve even more when members have
//             opportunities to contribute more and advance into new roles. To make
//             these changes as effective as possible, think about assigning new
//             roles when beginning new projects or when taking on new
//             responsibilities.
//           </p>
//         </div>
//         <div className="article_part">
//           <h2>3. Experiment regularly </h2>
//           <p>
//             Although teams are often most productive when they have well-defined
//             roles, consider experimenting with new ideas. The most successful
//             teams tend to accommodate informed risk-taking and allow ample
//             opportunities for learning, especially if these experiments have the
//             potential to generate better results.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             To introduce experimentation into your standard workflows, try
//             making time for brainstorming before starting a project. During this
//             thoughtful exercise, team members can contribute ideas for
//             conducting research, structuring a project or collecting and
//             analyzing results.
//           </p>

//         <div className="article_part">
//           <h2>4. Embrace diversity</h2>
//           <p>
//             The most effective teams embrace different skill sets, experience
//             levels and professional backgrounds. You should include members who
//             have dissimilar opinions and encourage different ways of thinking.
//             By welcoming members with diverse views, your team may consider
//             different approaches or goals.
//           </p>
//         </div>
//         <div className="article_part">
//           <h2>5. Share a common culture</h2>
//           <p>
//             Despite differences, the most successful teams share a common
//             culture, such as a company or group culture. Your team might create
//             and agree on these shared behaviors unconsciously, as they are
//             likely to reflect preferred working or communication styles.
//             However, your team is likely to be more productive when it has
//             guidelines to follow. As the leader, you should gather input from
//             members to establish a cultural values framework.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             For many teams, shared values start with a cohesive mission. You
//             should establish a singular team mission by reflecting on the
//             organization’s mission statement and the ways your team contributes
//             to this overarching goal.

//           <h2>6. Be accountable to the team</h2>
//           <p>
//             To build a successful team, each member should maintain
//             accountability. When each member is held accountable, they typically
//             do their best work. You can establish this type of accountability by
//             setting a good example with your own work, encouraging your team
//             members to discuss ways to improve and making a point of
//             implementing feedback. By encouraging group accountability, your
//             team members can find a sense of belonging and purpose.

//           <h2>7. Communicate effectively</h2>
//           <p>
//             To work together seamlessly, teams need clear lines of
//             communication. To streamline communication, your team should clarify
//             each member’s roles and responsibilities. This will show who is in
//             charge of what and what to do when an issue arises or a problem
//             needs to be solved.
//           </p>
//           <p>
//             Also, your team should decide how project updates will be
//             communicated, be it email, messaging platforms or project management
//             applications.

//             To ensure that teams reach their goals, work together smoothly and
//             perform at their best, they need strong leadership. You can
//             demonstrate effective leadership by being committed, accountable and
//             responsible for your work. To be a strong leader, you should also
